# Notes

### 19 Mar 2020
- Since this is obviously the online version, it was created and converted to a desktop version. To be clear, the online app was not created by me, all the credit goes to Web.Dev. I also stated that the desktop application was created by me, however it was a few simple code that I mainly created for myself but also wanted  to share with the community and helping others discover Web.Dev's app.
- In the licensing, Web.Dev's name appears there as well
- Check back here to be updated between both desktop and online app which his notes will appear in the app itself whereAs mine will appear in the menu's as you are looking at it right now.
